&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The teacher determines the duration, deadlines, and how to hand in the learning documents. The shared Google drive would be better.<BR>

The student, or the teacher, can use the diagram to manage his/her learning. The word 'Total' means the total points, and 'This Month' means monthly points the student achieve--Check it before the following month begins. The color designates in which month the student learns. When the student finished seeing the diagram, s/he can delete the diagram by clicking the diagram itself, clicking the three dots on the right top corner and selecting the 'delete graph' on the pop-up window. <BR><BR>
